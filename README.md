### Project Description (concise)

- **Title**: User-Centric Mobile Banking App (Rural-friendly)
- **Goal**: Simple, secure banking for low-tech users with clear UI and big touch targets.
- **Core Features**:
  - Signup/Login with Name + PIN
  - Dashboard: current balance, quick actions
  - Transfers: send money to another registered user (credit applied to recipient)
  - Bills: pay a biller/merchant (records merchant name)
  - Mini Statement: last 5 transactions
  - Receipt: ID, amount, date, balance after
- **Experience**:
  - Large buttons, minimal steps, plain language
  - Works offline-friendly frontend (static HTML/CSS/JS)
  - Lightweight, responsive, optional dark mode
- **Security (basic)**: PIN auth; server-side validation; MongoDB storage
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no framework)
  - Backend: Node.js, Express.js
  - Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **Data Flow**:
  - Signup/Login → creates/validates a `User`
  - Transfer → debits sender, credits recipient, creates two records
  - Bill → debits user, stores `merchant`, creates record
  - Statement → fetches last 5 `Transactions` entries
- **Why it fits rural users**:
  - Clear layouts, larger UI controls
  - Low cognitive load, simple forms
  - Reliable on modest devices and connections
